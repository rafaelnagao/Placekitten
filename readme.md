## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This test was created to practice the concepts and ways of creating automated tests in Cypress. I'm new to automated testing, so I'm still learning.

I created this test to validate the website Placekitten.com, which is a fake website for tests, with images, texts and links to be validated. And who doesn't like cute cats? 

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### ‚õèÔ∏è Prerequisites
This test was built using:


- Visual Studio Code v1.77.3 [![VSCode](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual_Studio_Code-0078D4?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual%20studio%20code&logoColor=white)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Node.JS v18.15.0 [![Node.JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-43853D?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Git v2.40.0.windows.1 [![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/GIT-E44C30?style=for-the-badge&logo=git&logoColor=white)](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Cypress v12.10.0 [![cypress](https://img.shields.io/badge/-cypress-%23E5E5E5?style=for-the-badge&logo=cypress&logoColor=058a5e)](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress)


### Installing
After installing all the applications described above, make a local clone of the project and branch to your repository, so that all changes will be saved correctly.

Access the directory where the repository will be cloned and type:

```
$ git init
```

This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâa Git repository skeleton.

You clone a repository with git clone <url>. For example, if you want to clone the Git linkable library called libgit2, you can do so like this:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rafaelnagao/Placekitten.git
```

or by SSH (if you already have a key configured)

```
$ git clone git@github.com:rafaelnagao/Placekitten.git
```

Open your cloned local directory and enjoy!

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
The tests are in the directory "~/Placekitten/cypress/e2e/placekitten.cy.js"

You can go to the terminal and open Cypress or run it through the terminal itself.

```
npx cypress open
```
or
```
npx cypress run
```

### Break down into end to end tests
The tests will certify that all elements are present within the Placekitten page.

However, there are two steps that I skipped, as the page contains an API error, in which it loads the page, but Cypress cannot load it, as it does not receive the response that it has been loaded.
